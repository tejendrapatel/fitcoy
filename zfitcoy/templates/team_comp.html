                      One of the toughest times of our era, the COVID disease came to our test , which we so far have fought whole heartedly with all our might . After having done around 800-1000 hours duty in COVID , dealing from asymptomatic to critically ill patients from general wards to ICUs , I realized it was a real painful affair for people from all walks of life .

We saved many lives but lost quite a few too. The joy of saving a life comes down to nothing in a flash when you lose a patient the very next moment.

                      My first big experience of dealing with emergencies came at Red Cross hospital where at times I was the only attending doctor and had to deal with everything starting from minor wounds to suturing, stomach ache to heart attacks, minor UTIs to renal stone pain!!

                      Since my early school days I have been attracted more towards sports as compared to studies.  From being an active participant in football and cricket games, I represented my school athletic team in inter-state athletic clusters in track events twice and won medals though in relays only!! My sports journey continued through cricket in college days.

This is when I started observing the difference in attitude, physique, intelligence and approach to problems of the athletes as compared to non-athletes.

                      The seed for it was sown much earlier, when I had a mixed interest in sports and my nurturing will to become a doctor. Both the things though are much apart since one requires a lot of dedicated study time and the other requires to straining yourself outdoors but fitness was one thing that came out as a common denominator for both the equations in my case. As sports are basically making yourself fit while a doctor strives to make others fit.

                <strong>I have transformed my body and can help you do same.</strong>
                  <br>
                I’m a Dietitian with Masters in Food and Nutrition and 100+ International CPD hours, Founder of FITCOY. I am here to check and evaluate your nutritional status and to work over it so that you can achieve your health goal with us. My journey has always been up and down but still, I managed to come on track. I have been an overweight child since birth. As I grew older my hormones started acting weirdly. It was difficult for me to start but slowly and gradually I started loving this process. I started from 72 kg’s and here I am with 50 kg’s. My thirst for personal growth continued as I dived into self – enhancement phase of mine. I would like you to give us an opportunity for fulfilling your health needs. We have a special approach for each client both at individual consultation and in team work.
